[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/open_saves.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/open_saves)

[Open Saves](https://github.com/googleforgames/open-saves) is an open source game matchmaking framework that simplifies building a scalable and extensible Matchmaker.

This package is predominantly a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/dart/quickstart/) generated client, using [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).

A shell script that was used to generate the Dart code included in this package is included at `scripts/generator.sh`.
It should be run from a local clone of the [Open Saves GitHub repository](https://github.com/googleforgames/open-saves).
